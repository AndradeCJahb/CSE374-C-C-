  bench.c
  
  Through multiple tests using default parameters (no other command line arguments) the bench.c 
  program has taken anywhere from 2ms to 10ms of CPU time, with an average of about 6ms. Total size 
  ranged from roughly 100-500 kilobytes. Total freeblocks remained below 70 throughout with their
  average size ranging from 1000 to 20000 bytes.
  
  The documentation/notes concerning uintptr_t in the spec were useful for the mostpart however some 
  stack Overflow was sourced for specific misunderstandings/questions I had. General notes from lecture
  slides were also used throughout.
